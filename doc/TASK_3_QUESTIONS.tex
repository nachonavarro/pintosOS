\begin{enumerate}

\item

\begin{itemize}
\item
We created a new \texttt{struct}, \texttt{struct mmap\_mapping}, which will be an entry in the memory map table. 
\item
The first member of this \texttt{struct} is a \texttt{hash\_elem} so that this \texttt{struct} can be inserted into the memory map table for a thread.
\item
\texttt{mapid\_t mapid} uniquely identifies the mapping within its process. It's also used to lookup the \texttt{struct mmap\_mapping} that contains it in the mmap hash table. 
\item
\texttt{int num\_pages} is simply the number of pages that the mapped file will take up when it is mapped. \texttt{num\_pages} is needed in \texttt{sys\_munmap()} so that we know how many pages to remove from the process' list of virtual pages, and so we can write the page back to the file. 
\item
\texttt{start\_uaddr} is needed so that we can actually find the start of the file after it has been mapped, such as in \texttt{sys\_munmap} so that we can find the pages to remove from the process' list of virtual pages and write the page back to file. \texttt{end\_uaddr} can be used to work out the length of the file, and is also used to determine how many bytes 'stick out' on the final page.
\item
\texttt{struct file *file} is the actual file that has been mapped to the memory location. It is used to write certain pages back to \texttt{file} in \texttt{sys\_munmap()}.

\end{itemize}

\item

We added 3 members to \texttt{struct thread} for memory mapping. 

\begin{itemize}
\item
The first member is \texttt{mmap\_table} - the actual hash table for the memory mappings. This hash table will map \texttt{mapid}'s to \texttt{struct mmap\_mapping}'s.
\item
\texttt{mmap\_table\_lock} is required so that we can lock before calling \texttt{hash\_insert()} and \texttt{hash\_delete()}.
\item
\texttt{next\_mapid} is the \texttt{mapid} that will be given to the next mapping. It is incremented after each successful mapping, to ensure the uniqueness of a mapping's \texttt{mapid}.
\end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Algorithms}

\subsubsection{Integrating Memory Mapped Files into Virtual Memory Subsystem}

\subsubsection{Overlapping File Mapping}

In \texttt{sys\_mmap()}, the number of pages that the file will have to be mapped to is calculated by doing \texttt{int pages = size / PGSIZE}, where \texttt{size} is the size in bytes of the file. However, since this is integer division, if \texttt{size} is not a multiple of \texttt{PGSIZE}, the final page won't be counted in \texttt{pages}. To fix this, we check to see if \texttt{size} is a multiple of \texttt{PGSIZE} using \texttt{size \% PGSIZE}. If this equals 0, then we can increment \texttt{pages} so that it is now correct. We then use a for loop, \texttt{for (i = 0; i < pages; i++)}, to check that no page in the file mapping overlaps with any existing segment. In this for loop, we use \texttt{get\_spt\_entry()} to check if this thread's supplementary page table has an entry for this page, which will be \texttt{((uint8\_t *) addr) + (i * PGSIZE))}, where \texttt{addr} is the address of the first page to be mapped to (this is the second argument to the \texttt{mmap} system call. If this function doesn't return \texttt{NULL}, then there is an overlap, and we can return -1 from \texttt{sys\_mmap()}.
